Application Name: 
-Shaux

Application Description:
The purpose of our application is to create an app that will allow multiple users to tune into a shared music queue. The queue will be based on user feedback, allowing each member of a party the opportunity to control the music. Each member will have the option to like, dislike, or add songs on the queue so that the pressure of ‘being on aux’ is shared among everyone.
